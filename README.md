## Example Conversations

### Finding and Understanding Code

```
User: "I need to understand how user authentication works in this codebase"

AI: I'll help you understand the authentication system. Let me search for authentication-related code.

*Uses roslyn_symbol_search with query "auth*" and wildcard search*
*Finds AuthenticationService, IAuthenticationProvider, AuthController*

Found several authentication components. Let me examine the main authentication service.

*Uses roslyn_document_symbols on AuthenticationService.cs*
*Uses roslyn_get_type_members on AuthenticationService*

The authentication system consists of:
1. `AuthenticationService` - Main service handling login/logout
2. `IAuthenticationProvider` - Interface for different auth providers
3. `JwtAuthProvider` - JWT token-based implementation
...
```

### Tracing Code Execution

```
User: "How does a user request end up calling the database?"

AI: I'll trace the execution path from your API endpoint to the database. Let me start with a typical controller.

*Uses roslyn_find_all_references on a controller action*
*Uses roslyn_trace_call_stack with direction "forward"*
*Shows the complete call chain: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí DbContext*
```

### Refactoring Code

```
User: "This OrderService class is poorly named, it should be OrderProcessor"

AI: I'll rename OrderService to OrderProcessor throughout your codebase. Let me first preview the changes.

*Uses roslyn_rename_symbol with preview=true*
*Shows all 47 locations that will be updated*
*Identifies no naming conflicts*

This will update 47 references across 12 files. Shall I proceed with the rename?
```
