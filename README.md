## üí° Example Conversations

### Understanding a Codebase

```
User: "I need to understand how user authentication works in this codebase"

AI: I'll help you understand the authentication system. Let me search for authentication-related code.

*Uses roslyn_symbol_search with query "auth*" and wildcard search*
*Finds AuthenticationService, IAuthenticationProvider, AuthController*

Found several authentication components. Let me examine the main service structure.

*Uses roslyn_get_type_members on AuthenticationService*
*Uses roslyn_trace_call_stack to understand the flow*

The authentication system consists of:
1. `AuthenticationService` - Main service handling login/logout
2. `IAuthenticationProvider` - Interface for different auth providers  
3. `JwtAuthProvider` - JWT token implementation
4. `AuthController` - REST API endpoints

The flow is: AuthController ‚Üí AuthenticationService ‚Üí IAuthenticationProvider
```

### Refactoring Code

```
User: "This method is too complex, can you help refactor it?"

AI: Let me analyze the complexity of this method first.

*Uses roslyn_code_metrics to measure complexity*

This method has a cyclomatic complexity of 15, which is quite high. Let me help refactor it.

*Uses roslyn_extract_method to extract logical blocks*
*Uses roslyn_rename_symbol to give meaningful names*

I've extracted 3 logical blocks into separate methods:
1. ValidateInput() - Input validation logic
2. ProcessBusinessRules() - Core business logic
3. PrepareResponse() - Response formatting

The complexity is now reduced to 5, making it much more maintainable.
```

### Finding and Fixing Issues

```
User: "The build is failing, can you help?"

AI: Let me check for compilation errors.

*Uses roslyn_get_diagnostics with scope "solution"*

Found 3 errors:
1. CS0246: Type 'IUserRepository' not found in OrderService.cs:15
2. CS1061: 'User' does not contain 'EmailAddress' in UserValidator.cs:42
3. CS0103: Name 'logger' does not exist in ProcessingService.cs:78

Let me fix these:

*Uses roslyn_add_missing_usings for the first error*
*Uses roslyn_hover to understand the User type*
*Uses roslyn_find_all_references to check logger usage*

Fixed:
1. Added missing using for IUserRepository
2. The property is 'Email' not 'EmailAddress' 
3. Need to inject ILogger in the constructor
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **MSBuildWorkspaceManager** - Manages Roslyn workspace lifecycle and caching
- **RoslynService** - Core service providing code analysis operations
- **Tool Classes** - Individual tool implementations with MCP protocol integration
- **Symbol Cache** - Performance optimization for repeated symbol lookups
- **Resource Provider** - Manages large results with progressive disclosure

### Design Principles

1. **AI-First Design** - Every response includes insights and suggested next actions
2. **Token Efficiency** - Automatic summarization prevents context overflow
3. **Error Recovery** - Detailed error information with actionable steps
4. **Performance** - Symbol caching and efficient workspace management
5. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new tools using attribute-based discovery

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Workspace not loaded" error**
- Ensure you've called `roslyn_load_solution` or `roslyn_load_project` first
- Check the solution/project path is correct
- Verify the solution builds successfully in Visual Studio

**"Symbol not found" errors**
- Make sure the file is part of the loaded solution/project
- Check that the line and column numbers are correct (1-based)
- Ensure the code compiles without errors

**Performance issues**
- Use `roslyn_get_workspace_statistics` to check memory usage
- Consider loading individual projects instead of large solutions
- Enable response summarization for large results

### Logging

Logs are written to:
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\COA.CodeNav.McpServer\logs`
- Linux/macOS: `~/.local/share/COA.CodeNav.McpServer/logs`
